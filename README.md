## Usage

There are two options. Use the images that in the ```images-coins``` or ```images-exchanges``` directory. This process takes a really long time because of the CoinGecko API rate limit. Or Download the images yourself using the following command:

```bash
php ./coins.php

php ./exchanges.php
```
